Notes
=====

Want to keep things simple,quick and useful. Didiwiki intended for personal
use - Notes, Todos, basic PIM etc - functionality should reflect that.

Keep deps lows, binary should just run - no dependance on external files. 
Should just work. 

Pending
=====

Apply Halski's '-' patch.

WTF am I not doing this in didiwiki ?


Stuff that would be nice to have
=====

- Auth
  - basic http auth 
    - set via user/pass in ~/.didiwiki/.htacess ?
  - Limit by IP

- Any secruity improvements in code. 

- RSS feed of changes / searches ?

- Simple REST uri like API for external getting/setting raw wiki pages

  - didiwiki:8000/api/page/ get|set|exists|delete

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <page>
    blah blah b    

    </page>

    * could allow param to just return data as text, is xml really needed *
    * - xml could be a pain for shell scripts                             *

  - didiwiki:8000/api/pages lists all pages
    - could do the same as changes ?

  - didiwiki:8000/api/search

  - didiwiki:8000/api/changes


- Rewrite Parser.
  - can be much faster but its not that slow atm. 
  - make generic, output text, docbook ( bloat - uneeded )
                   - REST api would make it easy to write other 
		     programs that did this. 

- Wikipedia style icons after external links etc ( done in css )
  - 'xxd' can convert pngs etc to c arrays useful for including
    small images in binary. 

- Also favicon.ico *DONE*, though better icon would be nice. 

- Improve serach.

- Interwiki style links ?



Stuff thats a little more out there
======

- metadata on pages / tagging / tagging by dates
  - used to build custom searchs, group stuff togeather
    - more PIM like. 
  - need to think more on this

- #include 'wikipage' style directive ?

- GTD tool, how would this work ?
  - lists
    - allow lists in pages to be referenced ?
      - /pagename?list=#    referenced by number
      - /pagename?list=name 
        - How do we name a list though ?
	  - *[listname] ?
      - also deliver lists as RSS
      - is this much use though ?

- Templating, let user overide header and footer templates.
