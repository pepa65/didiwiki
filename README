DidiWiki 0.64
=============

DidiWiki is a small and simple WikiWikiWeb implementation written in C.
It's intended for personal use, for notes, todo's etc. It includes its
own webserver and hopefully it's as simple as just compiling, running
and pointing your browser at it.

Installation
============

To build, do:
autoconf; ./configure; make
You can then (sudo) make install or run DidiWiki directly from src/didiwiki
On startup the URL for your browser will be printed.

If upgrading from an earlier version, it's a good idea to delete Help, Home and
didiwiki.css from ~/.didiwiki (or $DIDIWIKIHOME) in case of any updated
versions -- unless you want to keep your modifications to those files..!

Notes & Explanations
====================

- Pages are stored in $HOME/.didiwiki (you can override this by setting the
  environment variable DIDIWIKIHOME to a valid path).
  - The stylesheet can be modify there: didiwiki.css
  - A customized favicon.ico added there will be used instead of the inbuilt one

- The webserver part is heavily based on cvstrac's internal server, following
  the same kind of process:
  - It's a pretty simple lightweight forking server. A child process is
    forked to handle each http request.
  - These forked children are assumed to not be around for very long (
    less than a second ), thus no real attempt is made to free up
    memory in these child processes.
  - It's probably not very secure at all. !!PLEASE DON'T RUN AS ROOT!!

- The code uses asprintf in a couple of places. This might be less portable
  to non-Linux systems -- patches accepted.

- You can debug crashes by running 'didiwiki debug' which will not
  start the http server, existing in a single process but expecting the
  http requests on stdin.

- The formatting style is very similar to that of kwiki.

- Formatting syntax changes:
  - for italics use ^ instead of / (the slash is used too much)
  - Only text (spaces allowed) between [ and ] create valid wiki links

- It was written in C as to fit easily on a PDA..!

- To fully clean the build directory: make maintainer-clean
